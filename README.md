Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by my page.

I am a continuous learner and derive immense happiness in learning new things, technologies and domains. 
I have signed up for few courses on multiple online learning platforms and most of my whatever little time off work are spent on these platforms, doing hands-on learning. The process of learning is what excites me the most than the outcome of learning and it is something that gives me a lot of satisfaction and joy. 
Iâ€™m currently learning how to build applications using MERN stack through MIT-X-PRO.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am pretty good at cooking some authentic lip smacking South Indian dishes :)
